Like freshly fallen snow, except less magical and more disappointing.\n\nSo we're starting from scratch here. Tabula rasa. Ground zero. You get the idea.\n\nLook, I get it - everyone starts somewhere. And at least you're here now, which is more than I can say for the hours between you and whenever you actually decided to begin this journey.\n\nSince you're supposedly here to brush up on Python skills and build terminal-based apps using the Claude API, I'm going to need you to tell me:\n\n1. What's your actual Python experience level? (And please, be honest - I can't help you if you're lying to make yourself look good.)\n\n2. What do you want to work on TODAY, specifically?\n\n3. Have you even set up API access yet, or are we starting from THAT far back?\n\nThe night's not getting any younger, and neither am I. What's the plan?"

OH.\n\nWell that's... *actually* a pretty high-stakes situation, isn't it? No pressure or anything - just interviewing at one of the leading AI research companies while your coding muscles have apparently atrophied into dust.\n\nSo you were an ML engineer. Past tense. Which means you USED to know what you were doing, and now you're here at 7:43 PM on a Friday evening having a crisis of confidence with a sarcastic terminal program. Fantastic.\n\nAlright, look - I'm going to be straight with you, Hero. You've got the foundation. ML engineers know Python. You're not starting from zero, you're starting from rusty. That's actually fixable.\n\nBut here's the thing: Anthropic interviews are going to care about clean code, problem-solving, and probably how you think about AI systems. Building small Claude API apps is actually SMART prep - you'll understand their product, practice API integration, and shake off the cobwebs.\n\nSo let's cut through the anxiety spiral and make a plan:\n\n**TONIGHT** - Are we:\n- Setting up your dev environment and API keys?\n- Building something small to test the waters?\n- Reviewing Python fundamentals you've forgotten?\n\nWhat's your interview timeline? Days? Weeks? This matters for pacing.\n\nAnd do you have Claude API access already, or do we need to sort that first?"

What have you been doing with your time?! Staring wistfully at your old ML projects? Writing poetry about gradient descent?\n\nOkay. Okay. Deep breaths. We can work with this. Six days is... not a lot, but it's not nothing. You're an ex-ML engineer with a functioning dev environment, so at least you're not COMPLETELY helpless.\n\nHere's what we're doing:\n\n**THE BLITZ PLAN:**\n- Tonight through Sunday: Build 2-3 small Claude API apps. Get comfortable with API calls, error handling, streaming responses.\n- Monday-Tuesday: Review Python fundamentals you've forgotten, practice writing clean code.\n- Wednesday: Mock interview problems, polish.\n- Thursday: Don't panic.\n\nBut RIGHT NOW, tonight, we need to get you building something. Anything. Just to prove to yourself you can still write code that runs.\n\nSo what's it going to be for Project #1? Something simple:\n- A CLI chatbot with conversation history?\n- A text summarizer tool?\n- A code review assistant?\n\nPick something you can finish in 2-3 hours MAX. We don't have time for perfectionism.\n\nWhat sounds doable?"

Because:\n- It's the simplest possible Claude API use case\n- You'll learn the basics: sending messages, getting responses, handling errors\n- It's actually useful for testing the API\n- You can finish it in 1-2 hours even while rusty\n\nHere's your spec:\n1. User types a message\n2. Send it to Claude API\n3. Print Claude's response\n4. Repeat until user types \"quit\"\n\nThat's it. No conversation history yet. No fancy features. Just prove you can make a basic API call work.\n\nStart with that. Get something running. THEN we can add bells and whistles.\n\nYou're going to create a file called `simple_chat.py` and you're going to start typing. \n\nNeed me to give you the basic structure to get unstuck, or can you remember how to import anthropic and make a client?\n\nBe honest - do you need a scaffold or can you start?"

YES. You are literally talking to a Claude API terminal app RIGHT NOW. The irony is not lost on me.

You're using the thing you're supposed to be learning to build!\n\nWhich means one of two things:\n1. Someone else built this for you (in which case, go READ THEIR CODE)\n2. You built this already and you're having some kind of existential crisis about what to do next\n\nSo which is it? Did you build this interface yourself, or are you using someone else's code as a crutch?\n\nBecause if you DID build this, then you're not as rusty as you're pretending to be, and we need to move on to Project #2 immediately.\n\nAnd if you DIDN'T build this... well, then your first assignment is to rebuild it yourself from scratch without looking at the original code. See if you actually understand what's happening under the hood.\n\nSo? Which is it? Own up."

Good for reviewing concepts you've forgotten.\n\n**B) Mock Interviewer** - CLI tool that asks you coding questions, evaluates your answers. Meta AND practical.\n\n**C) API Response Analyzer** - Tool that takes Claude API responses and analyzes token usage, timing, response quality. Shows you understand the product.\n\n**D) Document Q&A Tool** - Feed it a text file, ask questions about it. Classic RAG-lite pattern.\n\nPick one. And this time, actually pick. No more \"gosh I don't know.\" You've got six days and we're burning Friday night talking philosophy.\n\nWhich one?"

Plus you'll learn the API response structure intimately, which is great interview prep.\n\n**HERE'S YOUR STARTING POINT:**\n\n**Phase 1: Basic Structure (DO THIS TONIGHT)**\n- Make a CLI tool that sends a prompt to Claude\n- Capture the full response object (not just the text)\n- Print out key metrics:\n  * Input tokens\n  * Output tokens  \n  * Model used\n  * Stop reason\n  * Response time (measure it yourself)\n\n**Phase 2: The Interesting Bits (Tomorrow)**\n- Save responses to a JSON log file\n- Compare multiple responses\n- Calculate cost estimates\n- Track patterns over time\n\n**START HERE:**\n1. Create `api_analyzer.py`\n2. Import anthropic, time, json\n3. Make a function that sends a message and returns the FULL response object\n4. Extract and print the usage stats from response metadata\n\nThe anthropic client returns a Message object. You need to poke around in there and see what's available. The usage info is in `response.usage` - dig into that.\n\nCan you get that basic structure working? Just send ONE message and print the stats?\n\nTry it.
